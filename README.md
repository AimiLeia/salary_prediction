# salary_prediction
The aim of this project is to create a regression model to forecast the total gross salary that a temp employee will get after being hired to a short-term job through an employer-employee matching app.
The dataset includes historical data with information such as start/end date of job, job category, gross wage amount, etc. 
Additionally, an estimation of the total gross salary is provided at a separate column, which is used as a baseline model.
The notebook includes the following steps:

__Data preprocessing__
- Outlier detection
- Categorical features encoding
- Correlation analysis
- Feature selection

__Model selection & parameter tuning__
- Search space for multiple models (Ridge, ElasticNet, Random forests, SVM)
- Bayesian optimization
- Cross validation
- Best model selection & overall training
- Comparison to baseline model


__Disclaimer__: The dataset is undisclosed, thus is not provided in the repo.
